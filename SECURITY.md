# Security Policy

The following security policy covers the QuickBox CE (Community Edition) as 
seen here within this GitHub repository. For reporting any suspected vulnerabilities
within QuickBox Pro, please create a private listing within our QuickBox Labs ([here](https://lab.quickbox.io/QuickBox/Pro/-/issues)).

## Supported Versions

The QuickBox Community Edition is under limited development and support. 
Meaning, it is a community aimed project. As such, any future developments are 
on hold as we focus on our QuickBox Pro project. We do however take reports
of security issues seriously and will work to have these patched upstream
in a timely manner. As such, any security reports and subsequent patches are
posted upstream on a rolling commit basis covering latest versions as they are
released within our master branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected 
security vulnerabilities should be reported to QuickBox.IO privately, to minimize attacks 
against current users of QuickBox before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be 
investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. 
This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for QuickBox CE, 
please IMMEDIATELY contact sec@quickbox.io to inform the QuickBox.IO Team.

*IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities*

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to sec@quickbox.io. 
You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, 
we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but 
historically within a few days.
